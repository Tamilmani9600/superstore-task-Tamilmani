## Project Tasks

### 1. Data Profiling
- Explored the dataset to understand its structure.
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, outliers, and relationships (like Discount vs Profit).
- **Output:** `profiling_report.pdf`

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and standardized dates.
- Handled missing values and fixed inconsistent categories/segments.
- Converted sales, profit, and quantity fields to proper numeric formats.
- **Outputs:** `cleaned_superstore.csv`, `data_dictionary.xlsx`

### 3. SQL Analysis
- Ran 12+ SQL queries on the cleaned dataset.
- Examples: total sales & profit, monthly trends, top products/customers, category performance, discount impact, outlier detection.
- **Output:** `sql_queries.sql`

### 4. Analytical Insights
- Generated 5+ insights about sales trends, profitability, customer behavior, category performance, and business risks/opportunities.
- **Output:** `insights_report.pdf`

### 5. Dashboard
- Created an interactive dashboard showing key metrics and charts.
- Includes KPIs, monthly sales trend, profit by category, top products, region comparison, and discount vs profit.
- **Output:** `superstore_dashboard.pbix` (Power BI) or `.twbx` (Tableau)

### 6. Executive Summary
- Prepared a 1–2 page client-style report summarizing key findings, high-profit segments, poorly performing regions, discount effects, risks, and recommendations.
- **Output:** `executive_summary.pdf`
